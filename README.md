# Sales_Insights_Analysis
This project analysed a year of pizza shop sales data (22 fields, 48,620 rows) in Tableau, generating key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, average order value, and total orders. I verified Tableau visualizations using SQL for accuracy. The analysis is split into two dashboard layers:
•	Dashboard 1 shows KPIs, hourly and weekly sales trends, and sales breakdowns by pizza category and size.
•	Dashboard 2 highlights top and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, orders, and pizzas sold, with filters for category and date.
These insights provide a clear view of sales patterns and product performance, supporting data-driven decisions.
